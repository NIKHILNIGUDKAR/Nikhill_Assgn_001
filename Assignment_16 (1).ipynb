They allow you to specify complex patterns of text that you want to match or replace, making it possible to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible using simple string manipulation functions. Some common tasks that can be accomplished using regular expressions include searching for specific patterns of characters in a large body of text, validating input from users, and extracting data from unstructured text. Regular expressions are also supported by many programming languages, text editors, and other software tools, making them a widely used and important tool for text processing."
