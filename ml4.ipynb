    "ANS---> A scatter plot is a graphical representation of a bivariate dataset that allows us to visualize the relationship between two variables. It is particularly useful for investigating the correlation, trend, or pattern between the variables. Here's how a scatter plot can be used to investigate bivariate relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relationship Assessment: By plotting the values of one variable on the x-axis and the values of another variable on the y-axis, a scatter plot shows the distribution of points in the coordinate plane. It provides an immediate visual impression of the relationship between the two variables. We can identify whether there is a positive, negative, or no apparent relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Correlation Detection: Scatter plots help assess the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables. If the points on the scatter plot roughly follow a linear trend, it suggests a correlation between the variables. A positive correlation implies that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. Conversely, a negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Outlier Identification: Scatter plots can be helpful in detecting outliers, which are observations that deviate significantly from the general pattern or trend in the data. Outliers appear as points that are far away from the majority of the data points. By visualizing the scatter plot, we can identify observations that fall outside the expected range and may require further investigation. Outliers can provide valuable insights into unusual or interesting phenomena within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pattern Recognition: Scatter plots can reveal patterns beyond simple correlation. They can expose non-linear relationships, clusters, or other structures in the data. These patterns can be crucial in understanding the underlying mechanisms or dependencies between the variables."

This provides insights into how the two variables are related. We can use conditional distributions to identify any association or correlation between the variables. If the distribution of one variable is significantly different for different categories of the other variable, it suggests that there is an association between the two variables"
